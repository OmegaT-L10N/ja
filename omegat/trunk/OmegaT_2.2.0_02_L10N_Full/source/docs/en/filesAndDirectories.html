  <p>OmegaT works with three types of files.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Translation project files: They constitute a translation project.
    Loosing them may affect the project's integrity and your ability to
    complete a job. Project files are the most important files in OmegaT. They
    are the files you will deal with on a daily basis while translating.</li>

    <li>User setting files: They are created when OmegaT's behavior is modified
    by user accessible preference settings. Loosing them will usually result in
    having OmegaT work with "factory" settings. This can sometimes cause a
    little trouble when you are in the middle of a translation.</li>

    <li>Application files: They are included in the package you download, most
    of them are necessary to have OmegaT function properly. If for some reason
    such files are lost, just download and/or reinstall OmegaT to restore them
    all.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="project" id="project"></a>Translation project files</h3>

  <p>An OmegaT translation project consists of a number of files and
  directories.</p>

  <h3><a name="project_location" id="project_location"></a>Translation project
  files location</h3>

  <p>When you create a translation project, OmegaT automatically creates a list
  of directories that will later serve as files repositories, as well as a
  number of files that will be used to set some project preferences and to keep
  the project translation memory. By default, a translation project directories
  are all grouped under the main project folder. Alternate locations for the
  directories can be chosen at project creation or during the translation. This
  way it is possible to select existing directories or create directories in
  locations that reflect your work flow habits. To change the location of
  directories after a project has been created, open <strong>Project →
  Properties...</strong> and do the necessary changes.</p>

  <h3><a name="project_list" id="project_list"></a>Translation project files
  list</h3>

  <p>In a file dialog opened by OmegaT, a translation project will look like a
  file with an OmegaT icon associated to it. From a file browser, however, the
  same translation project looks like just any other folder.</p>

  <p><br></p><img src="images/OmegaT_projects_and_subdirectories.png" name=
  "grafika3" alt="OmegaT projects and subdirectories" align="left" border="1"
  id="grafika3"><br clear="left">

  <p><br>
  <br></p>

  <p>Selecting the item with the OmegaT icon is enough to open the project A
  translation project <b>Example_Project</b> created with the default settings
  will be created as a new subfolder with the following structure:</p><img src=
  "images/Omegatproject.png" name="grafika1" alt="OmegaT Project" align="left"
  border="0" id="grafika1"><br clear="left">

  <p>Initially all the subfolders of a project will be empty.</p>

  <h3>Omegat</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt>The subfolder <b>omegat</b> will eventually contain several files, the
    most important among them being the translation memory file
    <em>project_save.tmx</em> (<a href="translationMemories.html">...</a>). The
    file <em>project_save.tmx</em> is the working translation memory for the
    project. With the autosave function activated, it will be automatically
    updated when you quit. It is the translation memory used to create the
    translated files. A number of TMX files with names of the form
    project_save.tmx.<i>&lt;date and time</i>&gt;.bak (<a href=
    "translationMemories.html#TMX_backup">...</a>) will later on be added to
    this subfolder. They serve as a backup for the project TM and are being
    added each time you reopen a project, thus reflecting its contents before
    the current session has changed it.</dt>

    <dd>The <b>stats.txt</b> file (<a href="userInterface.html#files">...</a>)
    contains the statistics about the current project and can be opened in a
    spreadsheet application to display segment and word count information. The
    information it contains is more detailed that what is displayed in the
    <em>Project Files</em> window. The <strong>ignored_words.txt</strong> and
    <strong>learned_words.txt</strong> files, if they exist, will be used by
    the spell checker.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Source</h3>

  <dl>
    <dt>The source subfolder is the space for the files to be translated. You
    can specify a new subfolder and add the files to it the project later as
    well in the project list window. Note that the structure of the source
    subfolder is completely in your hands. If the files to be translated are
    parts of a tree structure, you just need to specify the top subfolder and
    OmegaT will copy it all, while keeping the tree structure intact.</dt>
  </dl>

  <h3>Target</h3>

  <dl>
    <dd>When <strong>Project â†’ Create Translated Documents</strong> is
    selected while a project is opened, all the files in
    <strong>/source/</strong>, translated or not, will be reproduced here with
    the same folder hierarchy to reflect the current state of the translation.
    Practically speaking, OmegaT merges the translation information saved in
    <strong>/omegat/project_save.tmx</strong> with the source documents to
    produce the <strong>/target/</strong> contents.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Tm</h3>

  <dl>
    <dd>Translation memories from previous translations can be put into this
    subfolder. They have to be in the <b>tmx</b> format. Use available tools to
    transform from other formats. Note that project_save.tmx is the translation
    memory, mediating between your source and the eventual target. However, the
    ancillary TM files are available for finding most convenient candidates for
    untranslated segments.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>omegat.project</h3>

  <dl>
    <dd>OmegaT automatically creates this file when the project is created. It
    contains the <a href="projectProperties.html">project parameters</a>. The
    parameters included in this file can be modified from the Project
    properties window.</dd>

    <dt>project_name-omegat.tmx (<a href=
    "translationMemories.html#TMX_files_location_and_purpose">...</a>)<br>
    project_name-level1.tmx<br>
    project_name-level2.tmx</dt>

    <dd>These files contain the source and target segments corresponding to the
    contents of the /source/ folder at the time of their creation (usually when
    the translated files have been created).</dd>
  </dl>
  <hr>

  <h3><a name="user" id="user"></a>User files</h3>

  <h3><a name="user_location" id="user_location"></a>User files location</h3>

  <p>User files are stored in a separate location where they can be accessed by
  any version of OmegaT. The location depends on the platform you use:</p>

  <p>OmegaT comes as a package you can download from SourceForge. In this
  chapter we will consider the <a href=
  "installingAndRunning.html#Other_systems">platform independent package</a>
  that contains the application in a standard Java form. Other packages include
  a Linux <code>.tar</code> package, a Windows installer -with or without a
  Java Runtime Environment, a MacOSX installer and a source code package for
  developers. This platform independent package can be used on
  <strong>any</strong> platform with a running Java 1.5 runtime environment,
  including the platforms for which there is a specific package. The platform
  independent package comes as a compressed file that you need to decompress in
  the folder of your choice for install. Decompression is usually done by
  double clicking on the downloaded package. Once decompressed, a folder
  containing the following contents will be created:</p>
