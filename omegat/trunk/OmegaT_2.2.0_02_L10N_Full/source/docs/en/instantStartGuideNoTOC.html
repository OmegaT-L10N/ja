  <title>Instant Start Guide - OmegaT 2.0 User Manual</title>

<body>
  <h2>Start using OmegaT in 5 minutes!<br>
  - Instant Start Guide</h2>

  <p>This instant start guide covers only the very basics. Ideally, all users
  should read the User Manual to familiarize themselves with everything OmegaT
  has to offer. Shortcuts described here use the "ctrl+key" convention but Mac
  users should read "cmd+key" instead. The "cmd" key either has a "command"
  label or an apple mark on Apple keyboards.</p>

  <h2>Briefly, how OmegaT works</h2>

  <p>The OmegaT screen consists of one space with three distinct windows. Each
  of these can be resized using the mouse. On the left is the Editor where you
  type your translation. On the right, at the top, is the Match Viewer, where
  translation memory matches will be displayed. Below this is the Glossary
  Viewer, where glossary matches will be displayed.</p>

  <p>In the Editor window OmegaT presents the source text 'segmented' into
  sentences (or paragraphs). You translate these segments one by one. As you
  pass from segment to segment your translations are recorded in a translation
  memory. Once all the segments have been translated (or before, if you
  request) OmegaT will use the translation memory to generate the translated
  document(s) in a “Target” folder.</p>

  <p>OmegaT organizes your translation work in so-called translation projects.
  For each project OmegaT will create a set of folders. These are used to store
  the source documents to be translated, the glossaries you may wish to use,
  and any translation memories you may want to use. OmegaT also creates a
  “Target” folder which will contain the final translated documents.</p>

  <h2>How to translate using OmegaT</h2><a name="create" id="create"></a>

  <h3>Create and open a new project</h3>

  <p>Select <strong>Project → New...</strong> from the menu.</p>

  <p>Navigate to the folder where you wish to save the project files, and type
  in a name for the translation project. This name will be used for the main
  project folder; all the project files will be stored in this folder or its
  subfolders.</p>

  <p>OmegaT will prompt you to confirm or change the project folders to be
  created, using the dialog below:</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/NewProject.png" name="graphics1" alt=
  "Project settings window" id="graphics1" align="bottom" border="0"></p>

  <p>You can simply accept the location of the subfolders, but make sure first
  that the source and translation language codes are correct. Select the
  language code (2 letters) or language-and-region code (2 + 2 letters) from
  the drop-down list, or type them in by hand (the language code can be 2 or 3
  letters). Make a mental note of the location of the Target subfolder (for
  your translated documents). If you want OmegaT to segment by sentence instead
  of by "paragraph", it's a good idea to double-check the Segmentation
  Rules.</p>

  <p>When you click OK to accept the project set-up, OmegaT will prompt you to
  select the source documents for import. You can import individual files, or
  you can import entire folder trees (with all files in all subfolders). If
  you've accidentally imported the wrong documents, or too many documents, you
  can simply remove them from the Source folder of your OmegaT project (using
  your system's file manager, for example).</p>

  <p>To check your list of files to be translated, consult the <strong>Project
  Files</strong> window (Menu: <strong>Project → Project Files...</strong>, if
  it does not open automatically). If you have had to change the Contents of
  the Source folder, remember to reload the project first (Menu:
  <strong>Project → Reload</strong>). OmegaT opens the first file in the
  project list by default. Remember, OmegaT can only translate files in the
  formats below if they match the patterns defined in the file filters. Any
  other files will be ignored.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>OpenDocument/OpenOffice.org</li>

    <li>Plain text</li>

    <li>.po</li>

    <li>Bundle.properties Java</li>

    <li>XHTML, HTML</li>

    <li>HTML Help Compiler</li>

    <li>INI ('key=value' format)</li>

    <li>DocBook</li>

    <li>Microsoft Open XML</li>

    <li>Okapi monolingual XLIFF</li>

    <li>QuarkXPress CopyFlowGold</li>

    <li>Subtitle files (SRT)</li>

    <li>ResX</li>

    <li>Android resource</li>

    <li>LaTeX</li>
  </ul><a name="segments" id="segments"></a>

  <h3>Translate the segments one by one</h3>

  <p>Once you have defined the project and the files to be translated, OmegaT
  will open the first source file in the Editor. The first segment is
  highlighted in green; a copy of the source text is displayed below it, in the
  “target field”. (At this point, all text outside the target field is
  protected and cannot be modified.) You must type your translation between the
  tags <code>&lt;segment 0001&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;end segment&gt;</code>,
  overwriting the source text. Press "<strong>ENTER</strong>" to advance to the
  next segment. Note:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>To move to any other part of the text, whether above or below,
    double-click on the sentence or paragraph you wish to open.</li>

    <li>If you prefer to translate into an empty target field, set this option
    in <strong>Options → Editing Behaviour...</strong>.</li>

    <li>
      <p>You can change the setup of the Editor pane (for instance to show or
      not the source text, highlight the translated text etc) in the Main menu
      entry <span style="font-weight: bold;">View.</span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you press "<strong>ENTER</strong>", several things happen invisibly:
  OmegaT adds the segment pair (the source segment and its translation) to the
  translation memory and also automatically translates any other identical
  segments that it detects in the other project files. It also scans the
  translation memory and glossary in search of matches for the next
  untranslated segment.</p><a name="tm" id="tm"></a>

  <h3>Use matches in the translation memories, glossaries and
  dictionaries</h3><a name="tm_matches" id="tm_matches"></a>

  <h3>Translation memory matches</h3>

  <p>If OmegaT finds any fuzzy matches (30% or over) for the next segment in
  the translation memory, it displays them in the Match Viewer. The first match
  is pre-selected in the Match Viewer by default.</p><img src=
  "images/MatchesPane.png" name="graphics4" alt="matches pane" id="graphics4"
  style="border: 0px solid ;"><br clear="left">

  <p><br></p>

  <p>To insert translation memory matches from the Match Viewer into your
  target field, you can use keyboard shortcuts:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Press <code>Ctrl+I</code> to insert the pre-selected match at the
    cursor position, or...</li>

    <li>Press <code>Ctrl+R</code> to overwrite the entire segment with the
    pre-selected match.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If several matches have been found and you prefer not to use the
  pre-selected match:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Select the match you prefer in the Match Viewer: <code>Ctrl+2</code>
    for the second match displayed, <code>Ctrl+3</code> for the third match,
    etc.</li>

    <li>Then use the <code>Ctrl+I</code> or <code>Ctrl+R</code> shortcuts as
    above.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(You can tell OmegaT to insert any first match above a specified matching
  percentage automatically into the target field whenever the segment opens.
  Set this option using <strong>Options → Editing
  Behaviour...</strong>)</p><a name="gloss_matches" id="gloss_matches"></a>

  <h3>Glossary and dictionary matches</h3>

  <p>Matching terms in glossaries and dictionaries, that you may have included
  in the project, will be displayed for reference in the glossary and
  dictionary panes.</p><a name="searches" id="searches"></a>

  <h3>Use searches</h3>

  <p>OmegaT provides a powerful range of search functions. Call up the Search
  window with <code>Ctrl+F</code> and enter the word or phrase you wish to
  search for in the "Search for" box. Alternatively, select a word or phrase
  anywhere in the Editor pane and hit <code>Ctrl+F</code>. The word or phrase
  is entered in the "Search for" box automatically in this case.</p>

  <h3>Use Google Translate</h3>

  <p>In the Google Translate pane, you will automatically get a suggestion for
  the translation of the current segment. Press
  <code>Ctrl+M</code> and it will replace the current content of the target segment.<br></p>

  <p><a name="create_trans" id="create_trans"></a></p>

  <h3>Create translated documents</h3>

  <p>When you have translated all the segments (or earlier if you wish), OmegaT
  will update the target document(s) using the translations stored in the
  translation memory. To do so, select <strong>Project → Create Translated
  Documents</strong> from the menu. OmegaT will build translated versions of
  all the translatable documents in the Source folder of the project, whether
  or not they have been fully translated. The wholly or partially translated
  files will be saved to the project's Target folder. To finalize your
  translation, open the target files in their associated applications (browser,
  word processor...) to check the content and formatting of your translation.
  You can then return to OmegaT to make any necessary corrections; do not
  forget to recreating the translated documents.</p>

  <a name="tags" id="tags"></a>

  <h2>How to handle tagged text</h2>

  <p>OmegaT ensures that the formatting of the source documents (bold, italic
  etc.) is not lost by marking it with special tags. OmegaT tags are composed
  of one or more letters followed by one or more digit, using the "/" character
  for closure (for example: &lt;f0&gt;, &lt;/f0&gt; &lt;br&gt;, &lt;/s2&gt;
  etc.). You must handle these tags with care and make sure they will be
  included in the target segments in a proper fashion (see <em>tag
  operations</em>).</p><a name="example" id="example"></a>

  <h3>An example...</h3>

  <p>In these examples we've highlighted the tags to make them easier to see,
  but in OmegaT they will not be highlighted. The HTML tags, highlighted in
  <font color="blue">blue</font>, will be ignored by OmegaT as they fully
  enclose the segment. The tags, highlighted below in <font color=
  "green">green</font> have to be handled by OmegaT because they are within the
  segment. Here is an example of a segment in HTML:</p>

  <p><code><font color="blue">&lt;p&gt;</font>A different display font can be
  selected via the <font color="green">&lt;b&gt;</font>Display Font<font color=
  "green">&lt;/b&gt;</font> dialog. Open it via the <font color=
  "green">&lt;i&gt;</font>Settings<font color="green">&lt;/i&gt;</font> →
  <font color="green">&lt;i&gt;</font>Display Font...<font color=
  "green">&lt;/i&gt;</font> menu item. The font type and size can be changed
  from the dialog.<font color="blue">&lt;/p&gt;</font></code></p>

  <p>Here is how OmegaT will display it, with the translation in
  Afrikaans:</p><br>

  <p><img src="images/tagged_segment.png" alt="" border="0"></p><br>

  <p>When OmegaT has created the translated document, the HTML will look like
  this:</p>

  <p><img src="images/tagged_segment_target.png" alt="" border="0"></p><a name=
  "tag_verif" id="tag_verif"></a>

  <h3>Tag verification</h3>

  <p>OmegaT doesn't automatically detect faulty tagging in the translated
  document. Before you deliver the document to your client, you should
  therefore check your tags for errors.</p>

  <p>Select <strong>Tools → Validate Tags</strong> from the menu. A table will
  be displayed showing the segments where the source and target tags do not
  correspond. Click on the segment number. You will be taken automatically to
  the questionable segment in the Editor, where you can correct the tagging.
  Hit <code>Enter</code> to validate the corrected segment and check the
  correction by pressing again <code>Control-T</code>.</p>

  <p>In some cases tag errors may even prevent a document from opening. You
  should therefore ensure that you have corrected any tag errors before you
  create the translated files. Finally, you should always double-check the
  final formatting by opening the translated document in its associated viewer
  or editor.</p>

  <p>In some programming languages (e.g. PHP, C) special tags are used as 
  placeholders in strings that are used in combination with the printf-function.
  OmegaT can detect and validate these tags if you enable it. Select 
  <strong>Options→ Tag Validation...</strong>
  from the menu. You can choose between simple and full validation. 
  In simple validation only simple variants of the possible placeholder values 
  are used. This is usefull when the source code does not contain the more 
  expressive and complex placeholders and you get a lot of false positives.</p>
