  <title>Preventing Data Loss - OmegaT 2.0 User Manual</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h2>Preventing data loss</h2>

  <p>OmegaT is a robust application. However, you should take precautions
  against data loss when using OmegaT, just as with any other application. When
  you translate your files, OmegaT stores all your progress in translation
  memory <code>project_save.tmx</code> that resides in the project's
  <code>/omegat</code> subfolder.</p>

  <p>OmegaT also backs up the translation memory to
  <code>project_save.tmx.YEARMMDDHHNN.bak</code> in the same subfolder every
  time when a project is opened or reloaded. <code>YEAR</code> is 4-digit year,
  <code>MM</code> is a month, <code>DD</code> day of the month, <code>HH</code>
  and <code>NN</code> are hours and minutes when the previous translation
  memory was saved.</p>

  <p>If you think you have lost translation data follow the procedure below
  which will restore the project to its most recently saved state, in most
  cases within 10 minutes of the most recent modifications:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>close the project</li>

    <li>rename the current <code>project_save.tmx</code> file to something you
    will remember (like <code>project_save.tmx.temporary</code> for
    example)</li>

    <li>select the backup translation memory that is the most likely to contain
    the data you are looking for</li>

    <li>rename it to <code>project_save.tmx</code></li>

    <li>open the project</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To avoid losing important data:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Make regular copies of the file <code>/omegat/project_save.tmx</code>
    to backup media, such as CD or DVD.</li>

    <li>Until you are familiar with OmegaT, create translated files at regular
    intervals and check that the translated file contains the latest version of
    your translation.</li>

    <li>Take particular care when making changes to the files in
    <code>/source</code> whilst in the middle of a project. If the source file
    is modified after you have begun translating, OmegaT may be unable to find
    a segment that you have already translated.</li>

    <li>Get started with the aid of these Help texts. Should you run into
    problems, post a message in the <a href=
    "http://groups.yahoo.com/group/omegat">OmegaT user group</a>. Do not
    hesitate to post in the language you feel the most familiar with.</li>
  </ul>
