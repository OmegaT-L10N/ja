  <h2>Properties dialog</h2>

  <p>This dialog is used to modify the project folders and languages. It may be
  opened by pressing <code><a href="menu.html#shortcuts">Ctrl+E</a></code> or
  by calling <strong>Project â†’ Properties...</strong> from the <a href=
  "menu.html">main menu</a>. The dialog contains:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Area for setting project source and target languages with drop-down
    menus</li>

    <li>Segmentation settings flag</li>

    <li>Area for setting project folders</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All the fields are editable. You can either enter the languages by hand or
  use the drop down menu. You can type names of folders that do not exist yet,
  and OmegaT will create them for you.</p><a name="language" id="language"></a>

  <h3>Language modification</h3>

  <p>You have to bear in mind that changing the languages may render the
  currently used translation memories useless since their language may not
  match new languages anymore.</p><a name="segments" id="segments"></a>

  <h3>Segmentation modifications</h3>

  <p>The segmentation settings only address the way the source files are
  handled by OmegaT. They do not modify the segmentation of already existing
  translation memories.</p>

  <p>If you change the segmentation settings, some already translated segments
  may get split or merged. This will practically return them to the
  "untranslated" status, as they will not match segments recorded in the
  project memory anymore, even though the old and now not matching translation
  is still there.</p>

  <p>OmegaT may <a href="translationMemories.html#upgrading_TM">upgrade old
  translation memories</a> that did not use sentence segmentation, but not vice
  versa. If you change your mind in the middle of the translation, the
  project's translation memory will not be changed.</p><a name="folder" id=
  "folder"></a>

  <h3>Folder structure modifications</h3>

  <p>In case you intend to modify project folders, remember that this will not
  move the contained files from old folders to new ones. You risk ending up in
  a situation neither you or OmegaT know what the folders really mean, and
  which of them are being used.</p>

  <h2>Modifying project properties during the session</h2>

  <p>It is possible to modify the project properties during a translation
  session. However, the safest way is to consider all settings as final once
  the translation has started - unless of course you realize a major mistake
  has been made. See the <a href="preventingDataLoss.html">Preventing data
  loss</a> section for ways to protect your work.</p>
